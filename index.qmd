# Workshop Overview
Join us for an engaging and informative workshop on "Public Health Insights: Clinical Reporting Using {gtsummary}." This workshop is designed to equip public health professionals, researchers, and analysts with the skills and knowledge to effectively utilize the `{gtsummary}` package for creating comprehensive clinical reports. `{gtsummary}` is a powerful tool that streamlines the process of summarizing data, making it an invaluable asset for deriving meaningful insights and driving evidence-based decisions in public health contexts.

Through hands-on demonstrations and interactive sessions, participants will learn how to leverage `{gtsummary}` to generate visually appealing and interpretable clinical reports. The workshop will cover essential concepts, best practices, and practical examples that demonstrate the application of `{gtsummary}` in real-world public health scenarios. Whether you're a seasoned data analyst or new to the world of data reporting, this workshop will provide you with the tools and techniques needed to elevate your clinical reporting capabilities.


## What is gtsummary? 

The [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in **R**. 

A critical part of the work of statisticians, data scientists, and analysts is summarizing data sets and regression models in R and publishing or sharing polished summary tables.

The [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) package was created to streamline these everyday analysis tasks by allowing users to easily create reproducible summaries of data sets, regression models, survey data, and survival data with a simple interface and very little code.

The package follows a tidy framework, making it easy to integrate with standard data workflows, and offers many table customization features through function arguments, helper functions, and custom themes.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gtsummary.gif")
```

## Learning objectives

Build, customize, and report tables often found in medical journals and other research-related publications.

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you make summary tables in R (data, survey data, regression models, time-to-event data, adverse event reports)?

-   Do you want your workflow to be reproducible?

-   Are you often frustrated with the immense amount of code required to create great-looking tables in R?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. 
It will be expected that you can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%` operator is a plus, but not required.


## Prework

Before attending the workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R** 

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Most recent release of the [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) and other packages used in workshop.

    ```r
    instll_pkgs <- 
      c("gtsummary", "tidyverse", "labelled", "usethis", 
        "causaldata", "fs", "skimr", "car", "emmeans")
    install.packages(instll_pkgs)
    ```
-   Ensure you can knit R markdown documents
    - Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document
    - Save the document and check you are able to knit it.
