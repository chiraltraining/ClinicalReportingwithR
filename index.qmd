# Workshop Overview
Join us for an engaging and informative workshop on "Public Health Insights: Clinical Reporting Using {gtsummary}." This workshop is designed to equip public health professionals, researchers, and analysts with the skills and knowledge to effectively utilize the `{gtsummary}` package for creating comprehensive clinical reports. `{gtsummary}` is a powerful tool that streamlines the process of summarizing data, making it an invaluable asset for deriving meaningful insights and driving evidence-based decisions in public health contexts.

Through hands-on demonstrations and interactive sessions, participants will learn how to leverage `{gtsummary}` to generate visually appealing and interpretable clinical reports. The workshop will cover essential concepts, best practices, and practical examples that demonstrate the application of `{gtsummary}` in real-world public health scenarios. Whether you're a seasoned data analyst or new to the world of data reporting, this workshop will provide you with the tools and techniques needed to elevate your clinical reporting capabilities.


## What is gtsummary? 

The [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in **R**. 

A critical part of the work of statisticians, data scientists, and analysts is summarizing data sets and regression models in R and publishing or sharing polished summary tables.

The [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) package was created to streamline these everyday analysis tasks by allowing users to easily create reproducible summaries of data sets, regression models, survey data, and survival data with a simple interface and very little code.

The package follows a tidy framework, making it easy to integrate with standard data workflows, and offers many table customization features through function arguments, helper functions, and custom themes.

## Learning objectives

- Understand the importance of standardized clinical reporting in public health research and practice.
- Learn the basics of the `{gtsummary}` package and its capabilities for creating summary tables in R.
- Explore various data formats and structures that can be used with `{gtsummary}`.
- Learn how to prepare and clean data for clinical reporting using {gtsummary}.
- Gain proficiency in creating common clinical summary tables, such as frequency tables, cross-tabulations, and stratified tables.
- Understand how to incorporate descriptive statistics, including means, medians, and proportions, into {gtsummary} tables.
- Learn how to customize table formatting, including titles, captions, footnotes, and table themes.
- Explore advanced features of `{gtsummary}` for creating complex tables, including multi-variable summaries and interaction tables.
- Understand the role of regression model summaries in clinical reporting and learn how to generate these summaries using `{gtsummary}`.



## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you make summary tables in R (data, survey data, regression models, time-to-event data, adverse event reports)?

-   Do you want your workflow to be reproducible?

-   Are you often frustrated with the immense amount of code required to create great-looking tables in R?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. 
It will be expected that you can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%` operator is a plus, but not required.

## What you will learn? 
### Descriptive Tables 

Descriptive statistics for continuous, categorical, and dichotomous variables in R, and presents the results in a beautiful, customizable summary table ready for publication (for example, Table 1 or demographic tables).


```{r}
#| label: load-data-pkg 
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# load data 
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(gt)
data <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("data/KAP_Thals_Processed.xlsx"), sheet = 5)
```

```{r}
#| label: descriptive-tables 
#| echo: false
# descriptive tables 
data %>% 
  select(2:7) %>% 
  tbl_summary(statistic = all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})", 
              type = all_dichotomous() ~ "categorical") %>% 
  as_gt() %>% 
  tab_caption("Table 1. General characteristics of the study participants (N = 680)")

```

### Comparative Tables 
Comparative tables are a type of analytical table used to present and compare data across different variables, categories, or entities. These tables are commonly employed to highlight similarities, differences, and relationships between data points.They allow for a concise and structured way to showcase information side by side, making it easier for the audience to draw insights and conclusions.  

```{r}
#| label: comparative tables
#| echo: false
# descriptive tables 
data <- data %>% filter(`Do you know about thalassemia?` == "Yes")  

data %>% 
  select(2:6, KnowledgeLevelBinary) %>% 
  tbl_summary(statistic = all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})", 
              type = all_dichotomous() ~ "categorical", 
              by = KnowledgeLevelBinary) %>% 
  add_overall() %>% 
  as_gt() %>% 
  tab_caption("Table 2. Level of knowledge of thalassemia who heard abouth thalassemia (N = 610")

```



### Analytical Tables
Analytical tables typically refer to organized and structured data representations used for analysis, comparison, and interpretation of information. They are commonly used in various fields such as statistics, research, business, and academia. Analytical tables help present data in a clear and concise manner, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and relationships among variables.


```{r}
#| label: analytical-tables 
#| echo: false
# descriptive tables 
data %>% 
  select(2:6, KnowledgeLevelBinary) %>% 
  tbl_summary(statistic = all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})", 
              type = all_dichotomous() ~ "categorical", 
              by = KnowledgeLevelBinary) %>% 
  add_overall() %>% 
  add_p() %>% 
  bold_p(t = 0.05) %>% 
  as_gt() %>% 
  tab_caption("Table 3. Level of knowledge of thalassemia among university students (N = 610)")
```

## Univariate Regression Tables 
Univariate regression is a type of linear regression where you have one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (response). Regression tables are used to present the results of regression analysis, including coefficients, standard errors, significance levels, and other relevant statistics. Below is an example of what a simple univariate regression table might look like:
```{r}
#| label: uv-regression
#| echo: false
#| message: false
# descriptive tables 
trial %>%
  select(response, age, grade) %>%
  tbl_uvregression(
    method = glm,
    y = response,
    method.args = list(family = binomial),
    exponentiate = TRUE,
    pvalue_fun = ~ style_pvalue(.x, digits = 2)
  ) %>%
  add_global_p() %>% # add global p-value
  add_nevent() %>% # add number of events of the outcome
  add_q() %>% # adjusts global p-values for multiple testing
  bold_p() %>% # bold p-values under a given threshold (default 0.05)
  bold_p(t = 0.10, q = TRUE) %>% # now bold q-values under the threshold of 0.10
  bold_labels()
```

### Multivariate Regression Tables 
A multivariate regression table provides a summary of the results obtained from a multivariate regression analysis. This type of analysis involves multiple independent variables (predictors) and a single dependent variable. 

```{r}
#| label: mv-regression
#| echo: false
#| message: false
# descriptive tables 
m1 <- glm(response ~ age + stage, trial, family = binomial)
m1 %>%
  tbl_regression(
    exponentiate = TRUE,
    pvalue_fun = ~ style_pvalue(.x, digits = 2),
  ) %>%
  add_global_p() %>%
  bold_p(t = 0.05) %>%
  bold_labels() %>%
  italicize_levels() 
```
